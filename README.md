# DigitRecog
The web app allows user to submit a handwritten digit in the form of a picture and output the recognition result of [0..9].
The web framework is developed in Flask.
We used Keras with Tensorflow in the background to develop a CNN for digit recognition. MNIST dataset is used for training. Data augmentaion has been done using Keras ImageDataGenerator.
